# marwa's personal website
My project is called "Marwa's Personal Website," and it is... well my silly own personal website (but PINK!!!! Wow so special!!!) I made my project in VSCode using HTMl and CSS, yapping about myself while using silly little gifs that I found from pixel resource websites (mostly https://pixels.crd.co) and ocassionally following tutorials on YouTube and w3 schools (my goat). However, I've like... struggled with a lot of things (good thing though, that means i've progressed in my coding journey!). First of all, it took me a while to format things because I thought that learning flex-box would be daunting, but using the translate tool all the time technically almost broke my STEM pages and my sanity so I gave in and learned it on YouTube... and I realized that flex-box wasn't so bad after all! I also made a HUGE mistake during my process of hotlinking the pixels (oopsie guys!!! i didn't know what it meant before, and i'm SO sorry) and it took me a while to upload the pixels to an image hosting website and then put it into my code (hey man, i don't want to steal someone elses bandwith). And talking about pixels, using <span> CHANGED my life forever. Like no matter how small the pixels were they wouldn't align right next to the text, so I had to translate it (which broke my pages, as I said before), but when I found about <span> my problems were solved immediately and my pages felt so fresh and clean. Finally, I learned that adding alt text depends on whether or not the images contain important info or not. I kind of forgot to put it before, so I was stressing out about what to put in my alt text, especially for my pixels. However, one of my friends told me that you should only put information in your alt text when you need to explain something important (like the big images I put on the side), but if your images are purely decorational, just put alt = "" instead so the alt reader just skips it. This is to keep the flow going, and not confuse anyone! Anyway, that's a lot of yap (theres a bit more in my website... shhh) but overall, I really like my website despite the struggles of learning flexbox, positioning and unhotlinking my pixels, and last minute panicking to add alt text (guys don't be like me LOL)

ANYWAY!!! I'm doing this for fun and the Athena Award!!! ^_^ Very cool you should join HackClub hehe
